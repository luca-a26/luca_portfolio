        <div class="about-section-content">
          <div class="body-text">I am a GIS and data professional with 3+ years' experience in geospatial analysis, workflow automation, report delivery and data management. Working at SeekOps, I gained valuable experience in automating GIS processes using Python, improving the quality of company outputs and overhauling GIS workflows. During my time at Mcgregor Coxall, I was able to develop my GIS and spatial analysis skills and play a crucial part in several projects. My work provided my team with a detailed and data-driven insight into project locations, enabling them to make more impactful decisions and deliver more benefits for local people and stakeholders. </div>
          <div class="body-text">My desire to build a career with GIS and spatial analysis started during my Masters research project, where I focused on using a multi-criteria decision-making suitability analysis to determine the optimal location for tidal energy turbines in the Bristol Channel. In 2023 I started at Mcgregor Coxall, where I was able to utilise my skills in a range of projects covering the environment, urban landscapes, resilience models and much more. As the only GIS expert at the UK side of the company, I set the standard for quality context maps, spatial analysis, and automation. I moved to SeekOps in 2025, where I was given the freedom to apply my GIS expertise to bring the company's GIS workflows and outputs in line with industry standards, greatly improving report turnover time and enhancing the quality of deliverables to clients. I am excited to continue my development within the industry, exploring the latest developments in spatial analysis and workflow automation to expand my toolset and make a meaningful impact on the world around me. </div>
