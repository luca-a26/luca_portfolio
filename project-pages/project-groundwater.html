          <div class="body-text">Several indicators were developed to measure and score the resilience of an area to groundwater flooding. For many of these indicators, such as those relating to the physical environment, some form of spatial analysis was required. Demographic data was calculated on a household level by distributing output area (OA) populations according to the volumes of residential buildings. This allowed me to assign each residence with a population estimate from which I could calculate pedestrian flows, using the buildings as origin points. For broader data, such as that at the census level, it was best to visualise this as a chloropleth map of the study area. In this project I utilised analysis methods such as travel time calculations, terrain analysis, and street network analysis. </div>

              <span class="image-caption" style="font-size: 12px;">This project involved as many as 9 seperate sites throughout the county. I built this QGIS model to automate the initial data querying from the OpenStreetMap database. This allowed me to gather data for each site far quicker than it would take to do each site manually. The model processes and filters the data to ensure only the features I needed would be returned with the desired symbology. I now utilise this model for all projects, and it is particularly useful for generating detailed context maps of prospective sites in a matter of minutes. Additionally, I have also been utilising python scripts to generate these maps when the data has been collected, to ensure even faster production of high quality maps. </span>

The requisite data was processed in QGIS using census and other administrative data, then the betweenness was calculated via the Urban Network Analaysis (UNA) Toolbox in Rhino due to the advanced parameters it offers. This map highlights local pedestrian flow towards bus stops within the site and the surrounding area. This gives a unique insight into how access to public transport is impacted, and inform decisions on which areas to focus attention. </span>
