        <div class="body-text">Within my first few weeks at Seekops, I saw an opportunity to leverage my profiency with QGIS to improve the outputs and workflows of the organisation. I decided to dedicate any spare time at work towards creating a Python script which could not only overhaul their entire QGIS workflow, from importing shapefiles to exporting standardised maps ready for use in report, but also improve the quality of these outputs to deliver better insight to the customer. These improved outputs included a complete redesign of the QGIS map outputs and the addition of detailed 3D iamgery to reports via Cloudcompare, utilising 3D models and orthomosaic exports from drone imagery. Upon presenting first iterations of the script, management was eager to implemment it into workflows and relied upon my knowledge of the script to lead these changes and develop comprehensive and informative tools, such as confluence articles and github pages, for colleagues to learn how to operate it.</div>

          <div class="body-text">Some projects at SeekOps could consist of up to 70 surveys, each requiring data processing, styling and symbology, and their own map output. This would often require an entire day's resourcing from multiple analysts, and that's before before any future modifications to data and report revisions are taken into account. This script condensed the entire process into seconds. It ensured the user was able to enter the files and parameters they wished and would receive detailed outputs which were report-ready. Early iterations to the code accommodated a basic map template, which was the organisation standard at the time. This included a basic map, with a colour bar beneath showing min/max ppm values. Further data was supplemented on the report page and further throughout the document. This disjointed approach required analysts to manually enter values several times throughout reports. There were two types of sites we collected data on, offshore and onshore. Offshore sites were a lot simpler, usually consisting of a whole site and flare to focus on. Onshore sites were more complex, they required identification and labelling of the various constituent mechanisms of the site, such as condensation tanks, compressors and flares. The script required much more complex code to accommodate this type of site. </div>

                  <img src="../assets/images/IMAGE_NAME" class="gallery-image">

              - To add an image to the this area, copy one of the above, paste it below this comment, and change the following:
                  - IMAGE_NAME: the name of the image file in assets/images
                  - IMAGE_CAPTION: to the caption of the image
