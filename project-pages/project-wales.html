        <div class="body-text">This project investigated how the Brecon & Monmouthshire Canal, and its immediate surroundings, could be improved or promoted to facilitate greater interaction from visitors and the local community. The canal has a rich cultural history and holds significant importance to many communities, from the more urbanised southern portion to the rural and pristine natural landscape of the Brecon Beacons to the North.</div>

          <div class="body-text">The project required examining the canal through the lens of the urban and natural landscapes. This needed a range of data to be collected on a relatively large scale (as shown below, the canal stretches across much of South Wales). As such, the analytical aspects of this project weren't a priority, due to the size of the datasets that would be involved. This project instead provides a showcase of my capabilities to produce eye-catching and insightful maps which are ready for delivery to clients. </div>

              This is where the images in the gallery live. Here's a simple gallery image for you to copy:

              Full Width Image:

                <div class="gallery-image-container">
                  <img src="../assets/images/IMAGE_NAME" class="gallery-image">

              Half Width Image: 

                <div class="gallery-image-container half-width">
                  <img src="../assets/images/IMAGE_NAME" class="gallery-image">

                </div>

              - To add an image to the this area, copy one of the above, paste it below this comment, and change the following:
                  - IMAGE_NAME: the name of the image file in assets/images
                  - IMAGE_CAPTION: to the caption of the image

Additionally, this map includes significant urban areas within 5km of the canal. This helps to visualise where prospective regular users of the canal who may either drive or use public transport visit from, as well as identify the communities which may have significant cultural ties to the landmark. </span>
